## Content Enhancement

To improve content coverage (currently at 66.8%), the project includes a content enhancer that:

1. **Identifies Coverage Gaps**: Analyzes missing sections and pages between ToC and extracted content
2. **Enhanced Extraction**: Uses multiple methods to extract content from missing pages
3. **Automatic Integration**: Seamlessly adds enhanced content to existing output files
4. **Quality Assessment**: Provides before/after coverage metrics to measure improvement

### Using Content Enhancement

```bash
# Enhance content extraction from a PDF
python -m pdf_parser.cli --enhance path/to/usb_pd_spec.pdf

# Analyze coverage after enhancement
python -m pdf_parser.cli --coverage
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from pdf_parser.content_enhancer import ContentEnhancer

# Create enhancer
enhancer = ContentEnhancer(
    "path/to/usb_pd_spec.pdf",
    "usb_pd_toc.jsonl",
    "usb_pd_spec.jsonl"
)

# Check initial coverage
initial_coverage = enhancer.analyze_coverage()
print(f"Initial coverage: {initial_coverage:.1f}%")

# Extract missing content
new_sections = enhancer.extract_missing_content()
print(f"Added {new_sections} new sections")

# Check improved coverage
final_coverage = enhancer.analyze_coverage()
print(f"Final coverage: {final_coverage:.1f}%")
print(f"Improvement: {final_coverage - initial_coverage:.1f}%")
```

### Enhancement Techniques

The content enhancer uses multiple methods to extract text from problematic pages:

1. **Aggressive Text Extraction**: Relaxed positional tolerances for better text grouping
2. **Multi-Library Approach**: Falls back to alternative extraction methods when primary fails
3. **ToC Integration**: Links extracted content to corresponding ToC entries when possible
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintains hierarchical relationships with existing content
